## Hi, I'm Jiyoon 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an undergraduate student in **Urban Engineering & Applied Statistics at Yonsei University**, currently exploring how **data science and mobility analytics** can improve the way people move through cities.  
I enjoy solving real-world problems using data, building structured analyses, and designing user-centered solutions.
